## How to Run Fusion2X

1. Download/extract Fusion2X.
2. Double-click `run_fusion2x.bat` (Windows) or run `bash run_fusion2x.sh` (Mac/Linux).
   - The first run may take a few minutes to create the venv and install packages.
   - All dependencies, models, and FFmpeg will be installed automatically in the `.venv` and `models/` folders.
3. The Fusion2X GUI will launch. All logs are saved in `logs/`.

## To update Fusion2X

- Pull new code, then run the same batch/shell script. It will update everything in your venv and models.
